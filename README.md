## :link: How to run the application locally

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Firstly, we have to clone the repository to our local machine using Git.

```node
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

We need to navigate to the cloned repository directory.

```node
cd <repository-name>
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Then we have to install the project's dependencies using npm.

```node
npm install
```

This command reads the package.json file in the project directory and installs all the required packages from the npm registry. With this command, node_modules will be installed.

### Step 4: Set up the `.env` File

Next, we will create a .env file in the root directory of our project. This file will hold the environment variables. `.env` file will look like this:

```node
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/
```

### Step 5: Start the Server

To run our Express.js application, we will use the following command:

```node
npm run dev
```

### Step 6: Access the Application

Once the server is running, we can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:<port>` in web browser.

So, these are the steps to run an expressJs application locally.
